## My feature
This feature is a variation of the basic movement commands in 2d. The feature allows the player to hold the spacebar while moving to move faster, similar to a sprint key. This feature could be further implemented to a “dash” or teleport function that would allow the player to move faster and avoid objects, for that we would need to add a cooldown to limit the use of the dash.
sprint = movement key + space
